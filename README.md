I was thrilled to be accepted into the Bertelsmann Data Science Challenge Course by Udacity in May 2018, and even happier to see my efforts rewarded by being offered a scholarship to the Data Foundations Nanodegree, which I completed while pursuing the Pytorch Scholarship Challenge. It was a really gratifying experience to [graduate in December 2018](https://confirm.udacity.com/23PSUQ56).

### Phase 1: solidifying prior knowledge and building strong SQL foundations.

Even though I was already quite seasoned in statistics, having studied and practised both qualitative and quantitative research methods during my Master in Education at the University of Nottingham - using [NVivo](https://www.qsrinternational.com/nvivo/home) and [SPSS](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/spss-statistics-software), I very much appreciated the first part of the course that was dedicated to descriptive statistics. It allowed me to get a better grasp on concepts that I had not really worked on because of the usually small samples I had been encountering until then.

The Python course really went back to the basics and helped build up Python skills related to the field.

The SQL course was extremely complete for what was supposed to be the challenge part to the scholarship. I was impressed by how much I learnt such as the key SQL commands, how to filter a table using SQL commands, how to combine data from multiple tables, how to aggregate data and how to clean data using SQL.

### Phase 2: great real life practice.

Phase 2 allowed me to make a professional data science use of [Excel skills](https://github.com/SabrinaPalis/Data-Foundation-Nanodegree-Projects/blob/master/Data%20Foundations%20Analyze%20Survey%20Data%20Project.xlsx) and [survey analysis](https://github.com/SabrinaPalis/Data-Foundation-Nanodegree-Projects/blob/master/Data%20Foundation%20Analyze%20Survey.pdf), [practising SQL by investigating a database](https://github.com/SabrinaPalis/Data-Foundation-Nanodegree-Projects/blob/master/Data%20Foundations%20Query%20Database.pdf), and developing my visualisation skills with Excel and [Tableau](https://github.com/SabrinaPalis/Data-Foundation-Nanodegree-Projects/blob/master/Data%20Foundation%20Tableau%20Dashboard.pdf).
